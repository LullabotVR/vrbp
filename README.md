# WebVR Boilerplate

A starting point for webvr projects using [A-Frame](https://aframe.io).

* Based on a stripped down version of [A-Painter](https://github.com/aframevr/a-painter).
* Includes aframe-teleport-controls.

## Usage

- Grab a [WebVR-enabled browser](https://webvr.info/get-chrome/). Currently only the experimental Chromium build on Windows supports the Vive controllers. (You will need to enable these flags for WebVR and Gamepad Extensions: `chrome://flags#enable-webvr` and `chrome://flags#enable-gamepad-extensions`.)

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Then, load [`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.
